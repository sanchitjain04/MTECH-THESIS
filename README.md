# MTECH-THESIS
This is my thesis which i undertook in 2nd year of my master's program in computer science along with my internship.

## Brief Description of my Thesis:

Human pose estimation is a major computer vision problem that means to detect the
spatial area (for example coordinates) of human body joints in unconstrained pictures
and images.In other ways we can say it is to predict the location of various human key-
points(joints and landmarks) such as elbows, knees, neck, shoulder, hips, chest etc.Estimating
human pose is quite challenging problem due to the fact that the human body parts are
small and hardly visible parts, occlusions and huge variability in articulations.As strong
image processing models, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) comes to the rescue.


In this report I have included different approaches for human pose estimation, literature
survey of major approaches for pose estimation, detailed analysis, showed how wec can
use activity recognition as a use case using estimating of pose for instance here i used
drowning detection as an example, also comparison study of Performance of various deep
learning models like mobilenet on COCO Dataset.
